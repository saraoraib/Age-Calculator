# Age-Calculator

This project is designed to calculate and analyze the ages of individuals based on their birthdates. It allows the user to input an unlimited number of names along with birthdates in the format "dd-mm-yyyy". The program computes the current age of each person, determines the day of the week they were born, and provides key insights, including the oldest and youngest individuals. If only one person is entered, it will display a message indicating there are no oldest or youngest individuals.

The program also performs input validation, ensuring that the date values are correct (e.g., no negative or incorrect months/days) and provides feedback when invalid dates are entered.

Additional features include:

Sorting individuals by age from oldest to youngest.

Displaying the input in reverse order.

Filtering and displaying individuals born on Sunday.
